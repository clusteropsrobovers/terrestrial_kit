# 🌍 Terrestrial Kit – Ground Robotics Toolkit
Terrestrial Kit is an open-source hardware + software toolkit for building and deploying ground-based robotic systems, including rovers, autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), and terrain-aware bots. Designed for education, research, and field robotics, this kit integrates navigation, control, and sensing into one robust platform.

# 🧠 What It Does
- 🛞 Controls DC/servo/motor drivers with PID support
- 🧭 Integrates GPS, IMU, and obstacle detection sensors
- 🧠 Offers autonomous navigation & manual override modes
- 🛰️ Communicates via Wi-Fi, LoRa, or LTE for remote ops
- 🗺️ Supports mapping and localization (SLAM-ready)
- 🛠️ Modular for easy expansion (robot arms, cameras, tools)

# 💡 Use Cases
- 🚜 Agricultural bots for soil/plant monitoring
- 🚧 Construction & inspection rovers
- 🔍 Research platforms for terrain exploration
- 🧪 Educational kits for robotics and automation
